# Summer Datathon 2019
Citadel / Correlation One, Invitational Summer 2019 Datathon

# Problem Statement:
Does the Canadian single payer system provide fair access to healthcare for all?
Does it provide equitable access across age ranges, locations, types of population? How does the effectiveness of the service differ, and does that correlate to the needs of the population?
Is the system effective at shifting needs toward what the population at any one province needs?

How does Canadian simple payer policy decision making affect the effectiveness of their system throughout different reigons?

# Some background:

The Canada Health Transfer (CHT) is a program in which the federal government allocates funds to regions for healthcare uses.
The CHT broke off from the Canada Health and Social Transfer (CHST) in 2004. 
The CHT aims to support the principles of the Canada Health Act which are: universality; comprehensiveness; portability; accessibility; and, public administration.
From 2004-2014, the program consisted of two funding portions: a cash basis (provides equal per capita funding), and a tax point basis (places which generate less revenue per percent of tax collected, aka less economically productive regions, get more funding).
As of 2014-2015, the program is now ONLY operating on the cash basis -- meaning that they only care about giving out equal funding per capita now, with no additional assistance based on financial need.

An interesting question is: How has this shift interfered with meeting the medical needs of various age groups in different provinces? For example, do we see certain medical needs in the elderly populations that are no longer being catered to as a result of this shift to equal, but not necessarily equitable, funding?
